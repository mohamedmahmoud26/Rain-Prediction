# Rain Prediction Project - Team SkyCast

### Project Overview

The Rain Prediction Project aims to build an intelligent model capable of predicting whether it will rain tomorrow based on real-world weather data collected from Australian weather stations.  
The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and more, in order to make accurate predictions that assist in weather forecasting.

## Project Goal / Problem Statement

Many individuals and sectors rely on weather forecasts for daily or operational decision-making, including:

- **Individuals**: Planning their day, choosing appropriate clothing, or deciding whether to carry an umbrella.
- **Agriculture**: Scheduling irrigation and harvesting.
- **Transportation**: Minimizing risks caused by weather conditions

### Our main goal is:
**To build a smart system that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on todayâ€™s weather data.**
